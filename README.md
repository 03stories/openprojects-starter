# Open Projects Starter Project

This project will help kickstart open projects.

# Name: Open Projects
## Core Motivations / Frustrations
  * Most people observe civic and community needs instead of intervening to do something about it. This inaction is largely due to this pervading thought that we can't do much about it. 
  * Many companies, schools, cities, and other groups do an enourmous amount of overlapping work, without working with eachother. We're all citizens that share most things in common, and yet are used to defining eachother by our different roles.
