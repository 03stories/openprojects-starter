* Work: "Will this be on the test?"
* Art: You want to do more of it.
* Homework during day, lectures at night
* Open book, open note, all the time.
* Access to any course, anywhere in world, anytime
* Precise, focused education instead of mass batched classes.
* Raspberry PI
* Why don't we ask kids to figure things out? 
* Myth 1: Great performance leads to happiness & success.
* Myth 2: Great parents have kids or perform great in school.

* Article may be useful about thinking about how to pitch a project idea to get others involved. 

Started this Github project today as a prototype for creating a transparent and remixable form of project management. 
Doubt it's really the most comfortable way for people to get started, but may work with a bit of training. Naturally, it's especially useful for any projects that involve projects with code.

Downloaded a markdown editor called [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com). Just playing with some tools and editing styles for how to update the repo. I also, there's lots of online editing tools on Github.com. Noteably, they have Projects and Wikis and Pages. Pages may be the most useful thing, as it makes it pretty easy to put a nice UI face on your project. 

I need to think through and research more the core value of a version tracking tool. Perhaps the best thing going for it is the fact that it's practically the online face of open-source, and so there's lots they've learned and implemented around those needs. Obviously, it lends itself to programmers, but it's more or less a way to archive and share information online, which is the same fundamental activity of the other tools people use.

Had a great dinner meeting with Caleb Duttweiller at Tin Drum. He's a [3rd Grade teacher at Ison Springs](http://isonthirdgrade.weebly.com). Got a good rundown on what a school day and year is like. 
* Has students at various skill levels, often groups students by these levels and moves them around the room working on diverse subject area challenges. 
* Reading & Writing have to follow a rather strict curriculum schedule.
* Often the pressure of teaching for the test.
* Potential opportunity to collaborate on end of the year project. This would be after the big GA / Common Core evaluation test is done.
* Discussed about potential partner students in Africa and Japan!
* Opporunity to join in and help one day at school or just observe.
* A teacher mentor Ken Strayve is into this kinda stuff too, especially something called OutdoorEd.

We talked through starting to track key information about each person:
* What are you good at? 
* What do you enjoy doing?
* What would you like to learn or get better at?
* What skills are behind / ahead for this age?
* What do you really care about and would like to see changed?
